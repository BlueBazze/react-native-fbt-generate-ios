# react-native-fbt-generate-ios

**Original creators - Facebook**

This is a simple copy paste from the android scripts made by Facebook. Ive adjusted them to export to iOS. Reasoning being that Facebook did not provide this from what i gathered.

`Package.json`

```
"scripts": {
    "generate-ios-fbt": "babel-node i18n/scripts/generate-ios-localizables-executor.js",
}
```
